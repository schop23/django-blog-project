# Django Blog Project

## Why did you choose this subject and how were you first made aware of it?
I was first made aware of Python at a Linux user group that I belong to. They also formed a Python Meet Up group and I have attended a few meetings and presentations.  I wanted to become more familiar with it.  I didn't realize until today that Django was part of it.

## Why is it used?
It seems to be a beginner friendly language, so it is easy to learn. It seems like it can build really robust applications with it.  A lot of big companies are using it.

## What is your opinion on the technology after having built something with it?
It seems very similar to ruby and I liked that.  It wasn't too hard to pick up, but there are aspects off it that look strange comparted to program languages I am used to seeing. (Doc Strings!)
